A Github Pages template for academic websites configured to fit to my personal needs, this repository was forked (then detached) from https://academicpages.github.io.

Original work was forked (then detached) by Stuart Geiger from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme, which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.
